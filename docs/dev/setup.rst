Setup Guide
===========

In this guide you learn how to setup the development environment of
Artemis. Artemis is based on `JHipster <https://jhipster.github.io>`__,
i.e. \ `Spring Boot <http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot>`__
development on the application server using Java 15, and TypeScript
development on the application client in the browser using
`Angular <https://angular.io>`__ and Webpack. To get an overview of the
used technology, have a look at the `JHipster Technology stack <https://jhipster.github.io/tech-stack>`__
and other tutorials on the JHipster homepage.

You can find tutorials how to setup JHipster in an IDE (`IntelliJ IDEA
Ultimate <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea>`__ is recommended) on
https://jhipster.github.io/configuring-ide. Note that the Community
Edition of IntelliJ IDEA does not provide Spring Boot support (see the
`comparison
matrix <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html>`__).
Before you can build Artemis, you must install and configure the
following dependencies/tools on your machine:

1. `Java
   JDK <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html>`__:
   We use Java (JDK 15) to develop and run the Artemis application
   server which is based on `Spring
   Boot <http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot>`__.
2. `MySQL Database Server 8 <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql>`__:
   Artemis uses Hibernate to store entities in a MySQL database.
   Download and install the MySQL Community Server (8.0.x) and configure
   the ‘root’ user with an empty password. (In case you want to use a
   different password, make sure to change the value in
   application-dev.yml and in liquibase.gradle). The required Artemis
   scheme will be created / updated automatically at startup time of the
   server application. Alternatively, you can run the MySQL Database
   Server inside a Docker container using
   e.g. \ ``docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up``
3. `Node.js <https://nodejs.org>`__: We use Node (>=13.12.0) to compile
   and run the client Angular application. Depending on your system, you
   can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
4. `Yarn <https://classic.yarnpkg.com>`__: We use Yarn 1.x (>=1.22.0) to
   manage client side Node dependencies. Depending on your system, you
   can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle. To
   do so, please follow the instructions on the `Yarn installation
   page <https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install>`__.

Server Setup
------------

To start the Artemis application server from the development
environment, first import the project into IntelliJ and then make sure
to install the Spring Boot plugins to run the main class
``de.tum.in.www1.artemis.ArtemisApp``. Before the application runs, you
have to configure the file ``application-artemis.yml`` in the folder
``src/main/resources/config``.

.. code:: yaml

   artemis:
       repo-clone-path: ./repos/
       repo-download-clone-path: ./repos-download/
       encryption-password: <encrypt-password>     # arbitrary password for encrypting database values
       user-management:
           use-external: true
           external:
               url: https://jira.ase.in.tum.de
               user: <username>    # e.g. ga12abc
               password: <password>
               admin-group-name: tumuser
           ldap:
               url: <url>
               user-dn: <user-dn>
               password: <password>
               base: <base>
       version-control:
           url: https://bitbucket.ase.in.tum.de
           user: <username>    # e.g. ga12abc
           password: <password>
           secret: <token>                 # VCS API token giving Artemis full Admin access. Not needed for Bamboo+Bitbucket
           ci-token: <token from the CI>   # Token generated by the CI (e.g. Jenkins) for webhooks from the VCS to the CI. Not needed for Bamboo+Bitbucket
       continuous-integration:
           url: https://bamboo.ase.in.tum.de
           user: <username>    # e.g. ga12abc
           password: <password>
           vcs-application-link-name: LS1 Bitbucket Server     # If the VCS and CI are directly linked (normally only for Bitbucket + Bamboo)
           empty-commit-necessary: true                        # Do we need an empty commit for new exercises/repositories in order for the CI to register the repo
           # Hash/key of the ci-token, equivalent e.g. to the ci-token in version-control
           # Some CI systems, like Jenkins, offer a specific token that gets checked against any incoming notifications
           # from a VCS trying to trigger a build plan. Only if the notification request contains the correct token, the plan
           # is triggered. This can be seen as an alternative to sending an authenticated request to a REST API and then
           # triggering the plan.
           # In the case of Artemis, this is only really needed for the Jenkins + GitLab setup, since the GitLab plugin in
           # Jenkins only allows triggering the Jenkins jobs using such a token. Furthermore, in this case, the value of the
           # hudson.util.Secret is stored in the build plan, so you also have to specify this encrypted string here and NOT the actual token value itself!
           # You can get this by GETting any job.xml for a job with an activated GitLab step and your token value of choice.
           secret-push-token: <token hash>
           # Key of the saved credentials for the VCS service
           # Bamboo: not needed
           # Jenkins: You have to specify the key from the credentials page in Jenkins under which the user and
           #          password for the VCS are stored
           vcs-credentials: <credentials key>
           # Key of the credentials for the Artemis notification token
           # Bamboo: not needed
           # Jenkins: You have to specify the key from the credentials page in Jenkins under which the notification token is stored
           notification-token: <credentials key>
           # The actual value of the notification token to check against in Artemis. This is the token that gets send with
           # every request the CI system makes to Artemis containing a new result after a build.
           # Bamboo: The token value you use for the Server Notification Plugin
           # Jenkins: The token value you use for the Server Notification Plugin and is stored under the notification-token credential above
           authentication-token: <token>

Change all entries with ``<...>`` with proper values, e.g. your TUM
Online account credentials to connect to the given instances of JIRA,
Bitbucket and Bamboo. Alternatively, you can connect to your local JIRA,
Bitbucket and Bamboo instances. It’s not necessary to fill all the
fields, most of them can be left blank. Note that there is additional
information about the setup for programming exercises provided:


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Bamboo, Bitbucket and Jira <setup/bamboo-bitbucket-jira>
   Jenkins and Gitlab <setup/jenkins-gitlab>
   Multiple instances <setup/distributed>


.. note::
   Be careful that you don’t commit changes to ``application-artemis.yml``.
   To avoid this, follow the best practice when configuring your local development environment:

   1) Create a file named ``application-local.yml`` under ``src/main/resources/config``.
   2) Copy the contents of ``application-artemis.yml`` into the new file.
   3) Update configuration values in ``application-local.yml``.

   By default, changes to ``application-local.yml`` will be ignored by git so you don't accidentally
   share your credentials or other local configuration options.

If you use a password, you need to adapt it in
``gradle/liquibase.gradle``.

Run the server via a run configuration in IntelliJ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The project comes with some pre-configured run / debug configurations that are stored in the ``.idea`` directory.
When you import the project into IntelliJ the run configurations will also be imported.

The recommended way is to run the server and the client separated. This provides fast rebuilds of the server and hot module replacement in the client.

* **Artemis (Server):** The server will be started separated from the client. The startup time decreases significantly.
* **Artemis (Client):** Will execute ``yarn install`` and ``yarn start``. The client will be available at `http://localhost:9000/ <http://localhost:9000/>`__ with hot module replacement enabled (also see `Client Setup <setup.rst#client-setup>`__).

Other run / debug configurations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* **Artemis (Server & Client):** Will start the server and the client. The client will be available at `http://localhost:8080/ <http://localhost:8080/>`__ with hot module replacement disabled.
* **Artemis (Server, Jenkins & Gitlab):** The server will be started separated from the client with the profiles ``dev,jenkins,gitlab,artemis`` instead of ``dev,bamboo,bitbucket,jira,artemis``.
* **Artemis (Server, Text Clustering):** The server will be started separated from the client with ``automaticText`` profile enabled (see `Text Assessment Clustering Service <setup.rst#text-assessment-clustering-service>`__).


Typical problems with Liquibase checksums
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One typical problem in the development setup is that an exception occurs
during the database initialization. Artemis uses
`Liquibase <https://www.liquibase.org>`__ to automatically upgrade the
database scheme after changes to the data model. This ensures that the
changes can also be applied to the production server. In case you
encounter errors with liquibase checksum values, run the following
command in your terminal / command line:

::

   ./gradlew liquibaseClearChecksums

Run the server with Spring Boot and Spring profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Artemis server should startup by running the main class
``de.tum.in.www1.artemis.ArtemisApp`` using Spring Boot.

.. note::
    Artemis uses Spring profiles to segregate parts of the
    application configuration and make it only available in certain
    environments. For development purposes, the following program arguments
    can be used to enable the ``dev`` profile and the profiles for JIRA,
    Bitbucket and Bamboo:

::

   --spring.profiles.active=dev,bamboo,bitbucket,jira,artemis,scheduling

If you use IntelliJ (Community or Ultimate) you can set the active
profiles by

* Choosing ``Run | Edit Configurations...``
* Going to the ``Configuration Tab``
* Expanding the ``Environment`` section to reveal ``VM Options`` and setting them to
``-Dspring.profiles.active=dev,bamboo,bitbucket,jira,artemis,scheduling``

Set Spring profiles with IntelliJ Ultimate
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you use IntelliJ Ultimate, add the following entry to the section
``Active Profiles`` (within ``Spring Boot``) in the server run
configuration:

::

   dev,bamboo,bitbucket,jira,artemis,scheduling

Run the server with the command line (Gradle wrapper)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to run the application via the command line instead, make
sure to pass the active profiles to the ``gradlew`` command like this:

::

   ./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev,bamboo,bitbucket,jira,artemis,scheduling'

As an alternative, you might want to use Jenkins and Gitlab with an
internal user management in Artemis, then you would use the profiles:

::

   dev,jenkins,gitlab,artemis,scheduling

Client Setup
------------

You need to install Node and Yarn on your local machine.

Using IntelliJ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are using **IntelliJ** you can use the pre-configured ``Artemis (Client)``
run configuration that will be delivered with this repository:

* Choose ``Run | Edit Configurations...``
* Select the ``Artemis (Client)`` configuration from the ``npm section``
* Now you can run the configuration in the upper right corner of IntelliJ

Using the command line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should be able to run the following
command to install development tools and dependencies. You will only
need to run this command when dependencies change in
`package.json <package.json>`__.

::

   yarn install

To start the client application in the browser, use the following
command:

::

   yarn start

This compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript code, starts the hot module
replacement feature in Webpack (i.e. whenever you change a TypeScript
file and save, the client is automatically reloaded with the new code)
and will start the client application in your browser on
``http://localhost:9000``. If you have activated the JIRA profile (see
above in Server Setup) and if you have configured
``application-artemis.yml`` correctly, then you should be able to login
with your TUM Online account.

For more information, review `Working with
Angular <https://www.jhipster.tech/development/#working-with-angular>`__.
For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at
`Using JHipster in
development <http://www.jhipster.tech/development>`__.

Customize your Artemis instance
-------------------------------

You can define the following custom assets for Artemis to be used
instead of the TUM defaults:

* The logo next to the “Artemis” heading on the navbar → ``${artemisRunDirectory}/public/images/logo.png``
* The favicon → ``${artemisRunDirectory}/public/images/favicon.ico``
* The privacy statement HTML → ``${artemisRunDirectory}/public/content/privacy_statement.html``
* The contact email address in the ``application-{dev,prod}.yml`` configuration file under the key ``info.contact``
* The imprint link in the ``application-{dev,prod}.yml`` configuration file under the key ``info.imprint``

Alternative: Using docker-compose
---------------------------------

A full functioning development environment can also be set up using
docker-compose:

1. Install `docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`__ and `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__
2. Configure the credentials in ``application-artemis.yml`` in the folder ``src/main/resources/config`` as described above
3. Run ``docker-compose up``
4. Go to http://localhost:9000

The client and the server will run in different containers. As yarn is
used with its live reload mode to build and run the client, any change
in the client’s codebase will trigger a rebuild automatically. In case
of changes in the codebase of the server one has to restart the
``artemis-server`` container via
``docker-compose restart artemis-server``.

(Native) Running and Debugging from IDEs is currently not supported.

Get a shell into the containers:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  app container:
   ``docker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q artemis-app) sh``
-  mysql container:
   ``docker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q artemis-mysql) mysql``

Other useful commands:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Stop the server: ``docker-compose stop artemis-server`` (restart via
   ``docker-compose start artemis-server``)
-  Stop the client: ``docker-compose stop artemis-client`` (restart via
   ``docker-compose start artemis-client``)

Text Assessment Clustering Service
----------------------------------

The semi-automatic text assessment relies on the Athene_ service.
To enable automatic text assessments, special configuration is required:

Enable the ``automaticText`` Spring profile:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   --spring.profiles.active=dev,bamboo,bitbucket,jira,artemis,scheduling,automaticText

Configure API Endpoints:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Athene service is running on a dedicated machine and is adressed via
HTTP. We need to extend the configuration in the file
``src/main/resources/config/application-artemis.yml`` like so:

.. code:: yaml

   artemis:
     # ...
     automatic-text:
       segmentation-url: http://localhost:8000/segment
       material-upload-url: http://localhost:8001/upload
       embedding-url: http://localhost:8001/embed
       embedding-chunk-size: 50
       clustering-url: http://localhost:8002/cluster
       secret: null

.. _Athene: https://github.com/ls1intum/Athene
